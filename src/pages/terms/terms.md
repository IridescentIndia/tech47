#### Performance Indicators

We like to provide our services and measure the same using key performance indicators. These could be things like web site loading performance or other indicators as suitable to our clients.

#### Maintenance 

Maintenance of the software we develop is not part of the responsibility, unless it is explicitly in our agreement.


#### Fees

Our services are discounted and sometimes at no cost for Social enterprises and NGOs. Some social enterprises or NGO's may not fall into our area of interest, in which case we will let you know up front.
