sherpafeet is a platform for trekking guides. Trekking guides is a disorganised industry.
Anyone who has done a couple of treks can claim to be a trek guide. Thats great. But in the process, the native people who depend on this profession for their livelihood were losing out. sherpafeet is a social enterprise which not only helps the native people but is grounded on the core concepts of sustainability.
