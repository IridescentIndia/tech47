  The mighty chunks rise all over the world, including the oceans. They usually

  have steep, sloping sides and sharp or rounded ridges, and a high point,

  called a peak or summit. Most geologists classify a mountain as a landform

  that rises at least 1,000 feet (300 meters) or more above its surrounding

  area. A mountain range is a series or chain of mountains that are close

  together.
