 [sherpafeet](https://sherpafeet.com) is a platform for trekking guides. Trekking guides is a disorganised industry.
 Anyone who has done a couple of treks can claim to be a trek guide. Thats great. But in the process, the native people who depend on this profession for their livelihood were losing out. sherpafeet is a social enterprise which not only helps the native people but is grounded on the core concepts of sustainability.

 ## Technology which drives sherpafeet
 The sherpafeet platform is built on the MERN Stack. That is
 - [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/)
 - [reactjs](https://reactjs.org)
 - [Express](https://expressjs.com)
 - [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org)


 ## Hosting and Devops
 The platform is hosted on Amazon Web Services.

 ## Search Functionality
 The search functionality on sherpafeet is powered by [Elastic Search](https://www.elastic.co/)

 ## APIs
